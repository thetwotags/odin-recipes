    <h2>How to Pick and Store Zucchini</h2>
        <p>Zucchini grown quickly, and they can become enormous if left unharvested. Leave zucchini on the vine too long, and the flesh becomes stringy, tough, and bitter tasting. Smaller zukes are typically the tastiest and most tender. They should be plump and firm without blemishes or soft spots and have a decent weight to them. Larger zucchini are good candidates for stuffing or turning into zucchini relish.</p>
        <p>Zucchini are fairly delicate veggies. Store them in the refrigerator -- and if you have an abundance from the garden, it's okay to freeze them. To freeze zucchini, first bring a pot of salted water to boil; slice the zucchini in half and quickly blanch them for 2 minutes; then dunk them in ice water, pat dry, and store in the freezer in plastic freezer bags.</p>

                <li>Add any seasonings such as garlic, salt, and/or pepper. Stir for an additional minute and remove from heat.</li>
            </ol>
